# 🎮 Tiki-Taka-Toe ⚽  

**Live 🔗:** [Play the Game](https://laoluah.github.io/Orange-Blue-Tiki-Taka-Toe-Twist/)

I've named this **Tiki-Taka Toe**, giving a pun on the regular game due to my love of football!  
This is a modern and feature-rich Tic-Tac-Toe game with a scoreboard, target wins, and avatar selection.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
